# Creates a minimal venv and installs hatch locally.

# Usage: `source gethatch`

# If venv already exists, then it will still attempt to
# create the .venv directory and install hatch. This will
# fail with an error, but the ultimate result will still
# be the local virtual environment being sourced and hatch
# being installed locally if it is not already.

mkdir .venv
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install hatch
